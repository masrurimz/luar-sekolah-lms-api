# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Course CRUD feature provides comprehensive course management capabilities for the LMS platform. This feature enables public creation, reading, updating, and deletion of courses with essential metadata including pricing, categorization, and multimedia support. The system supports open course management with private enrollment and personal course tracking, aligning with the platform's educational mission.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the LMS platform's goal of providing comprehensive educational content management by:
- Enabling public course catalog management with open CRUD operations
- Supporting multiple course categories (Prakerja, SPL) for diverse learning pathways
- Providing flexible pricing models for different course types
- Ensuring proper content governance through optional creator attribution
- Maintaining data integrity through proper validation and relationships
- Supporting private enrollment tracking and personal course management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Public Course Discovery

**User Story:** As any user (public), I want to browse and view available courses, so that I can discover learning opportunities that match my interests and budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses the courses endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a list of all available courses with basic metadata
2. WHEN any user requests a specific course by ID THEN the system SHALL return complete course details including thumbnail and rating
3. IF a course does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN courses are listed THEN the system SHALL include name, price, category tags, thumbnail, and rating information

### Requirement 2: Course Creation

**User Story:** As any user (public), I want to create new courses, so that I can share educational content with students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user submits course creation data THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, price, category tags)
2. IF required fields are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field information
3. WHEN course creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the created course with generated ID and timestamps
4. WHEN an authenticated user creates a course THEN the system SHALL optionally associate it with the user as the creator
5. WHEN a public user creates a course THEN the system SHALL create the course without creator attribution

### Requirement 3: Course Management

**User Story:** As any user (public), I want to update and delete courses, so that I can maintain accurate and current course information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user attempts to update a course THEN the system SHALL allow the update without authentication requirements
2. WHEN course update succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the updated course with modified timestamp
3. WHEN any user attempts to delete a course THEN the system SHALL allow the deletion without authentication requirements
4. IF course deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL remove the course and return success confirmation
5. IF the course to update/delete does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 4: Course Data Structure

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want consistent course data structure, so that the system maintains data integrity and supports future features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL require name (string, non-empty)
2. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL require price (numeric, 2 decimal places, non-negative)
3. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL require categoryTag (array, contains "prakerja" and/or "spl")
4. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL optionally store thumbnail (string, URL format)
5. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL optionally store rating (numeric, 1-5 scale, 1 decimal place)
6. WHEN a course is stored THEN the system SHALL automatically generate timestamps for creation and last update
7. WHEN a course is created by authenticated user THEN the system SHALL optionally store the creator's user ID

### Requirement 5: Private Course Enrollment

**User Story:** As an authenticated student, I want to enroll in courses, so that I can track my learning progress and access enrolled content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user attempts to enroll in a course THEN the system SHALL verify the course exists
2. IF the course exists THEN the system SHALL create an enrollment record linking the user to the course
3. IF the user is already enrolled THEN the system SHALL return appropriate conflict response
4. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
5. WHEN enrollment succeeds THEN the system SHALL return confirmation with enrollment details

### Requirement 6: Private My Courses Listing

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my enrolled courses, so that I can track my learning progress and access my course content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user requests their enrolled courses THEN the system SHALL return a list of courses they are enrolled in
2. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
3. WHEN courses are listed THEN the system SHALL include course details and enrollment information
4. IF the user has no enrolled courses THEN the system SHALL return an empty list

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each CRUD operation shall be implemented in separate, focused handler functions
- **Modular Design**: Course schema, validation, and business logic shall be separated into distinct modules
- **Dependency Management**: Database operations shall use dependency injection pattern with database parameter as first argument
- **Clear Interfaces**: All API endpoints shall have well-defined input/output contracts using Zod schemas

### Performance
- **Response Time**: API responses shall complete within 500ms for database operations
- **Scalability**: Course listing shall support pagination for large catalogs (1000+ courses)
- **Database Efficiency**: All queries shall use proper indexing and optimized joins

### Security
- **Authentication**: Course CRUD operations shall be publicly accessible without authentication requirements
- **Authorization**: Enrollment and "my courses" listing shall require authentication
- **Input Validation**: All inputs shall be validated using Zod schemas with proper error messages
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database operations shall use parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM
- **Data Privacy**: User enrollment data shall be protected and only accessible to the enrolled user

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: All operations shall have comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Data Integrity**: Database constraints shall prevent invalid data states
- **Transaction Safety**: Related operations shall use database transactions when needed

### Usability
- **API Consistency**: All endpoints shall follow consistent RESTful patterns and response formats
- **Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI documentation shall be auto-generated from oRPC contracts
- **Developer Experience**: Type-safe client generation shall provide excellent IDE support
